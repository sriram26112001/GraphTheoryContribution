ðŸš€ Graph Theory â€“ Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains clean and scalable implementations of core Graph Theory concepts in Java. Each problem is solved with clear logic, optimized time/space complexity, and proper modular structure.

ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
Topic	Description
Graph Representation	Using Adjacency List
BFS / DFS	Traversal of graphs using Breadth-First and Depth-First Search
Cycle Detection	For both directed and undirected graphs
Topological Sort	Using Kahnâ€™s algorithm (BFS-based)
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm	Shortest path in a weighted graph
ðŸ”§ Technologies

Language: Java

Compiler: JDK 17+

âœ… How to Run
# Compile

Each file has a main method with sample input for quick testing.

ðŸ“Œ Contribution Goals

Master graph traversal techniques
Build reusable utility functions
Write clean, maintainable, and testable code
Improve algorithmic problem-solving using real-world scenarios

ðŸ“– Sample Intuition

To build the adjacency list, initialize an array of empty ArrayLists of size equal to number of nodes.
Use a function addEdge(src, dest) to insert connections.
Traversal (BFS/DFS) uses a visited array and recursion/queue.
